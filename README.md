# Repository for the Minecraft Plugin "Random Additions"
Created for the ASE-Course (SS2024) at the HTW Saarbr√ºcken. <hr/>
The plugin adds random features to the game to learn about the Bukkit API, Java and the use of automations. <hr/>
The plugin uses the Bukkit API for Minecraft 1.20.6 and is meant to run on a PaperMC 1.20.6 server. <hr/>
The maven site (with informations about the dependencies and test coverage reports) is available [here](https://matthias-pmr.github.io/random-additions/).

## Learning

- Ideas and help was found on the [official PaperMC documentation on the Bukkit API](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.20.6/).
- UnitTesting was done thanks to [MockBukkit](https://github.com/MockBukkit/).

## Setup

Get the jar artefacts from the GitHub actions and put them in the plugins folder of your Minecraft server.
